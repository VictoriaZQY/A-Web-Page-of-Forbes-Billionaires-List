# A-Web-Page-of-Forbes-Billionaires-List
A web page of Forbes Billionaires List. It contains 2 types of users: regular users who can only search and view, and administrators who can add, delete, change, search. 

To notice, we set up some special functions in the web page.

1. The extensible sidebar. The sidebar on the left can display different items within one page through a click.
2. The alphabet nav. The positioning of those billionaires' names is set according to the initials of the names in the right sidebar.
3. The search boxes on each page have different search ranges. On the top of the front page, the search box can search for anything from any table in the database. Moreover, on each page, the search box can search for anything in the table on this page. Moreover, 2 buttons are set to easily back to the previous page and the home page.
4. The scrolling images on the home page can be clicked thus positioning the corresponding text on that page. Also, they can move smoothly.
